# EventRegistrationSystem

<!-- This project performs the task of developing a web application that enables the students and 
faculty to recover the information effectively. The main reason for event management system 
is to give a platform to the clients to view the data about the events that occurred past and 
about the event took place in the near future. The clients can be faulty, students and 
administrator. They can the first login into the site and transparent the data, for example, 
insights about the occasions like the setting, topic of the occasion, members, boss visitors, and 
so forth. The staff can keep the record of the attendance also. The administrator can log in 
and update the data, delete any unwanted information, arrange the data as needs be with the 
goal that the client can experience an easy to use and know all the whereabouts of their 
college.
I can assist the user to concentrate on their other activities rather than concentrating on 
maintaining the record. Thus it will help organizers in better utilization of resources. The 
organization can maintain computerized records without redundant entries. This means, one 
need not be distracted by information that is not relevant while being able to reach the 
information.
The project is developed using XAMPP Server, MySQL, HTML, PHP and CSS. The project is 
evaluated for different participants participating in the various events and is found to work 
satisfactorily and different test conditions.
